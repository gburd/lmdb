%% How to:
%% * put the emdb.config file into basho_bench/examples
%% * put the basho_bench_driver_emdb.erl into basho_bench/src
%% * make clean in basho_bench, then make
%% * edit examples/emdb.config
%%   - change {code_paths, ["../emdb"]}. to be a relative path to your
%%     emdb directory
%%   - change {emdb_dir, "/home/gburd/ws/basho_bench/data"}. to a fully
%%     qualified location for your test data files (mkdir that directory
%%     yourself, if it doesn't exist the test will fail 'enoent')
%% * to run, replace this path with the proper path on your system:
%%   LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/you/emdb/priv ./basho_bench examples/emdb.config
%% * the test should run for 10 minutes (as it is configured right now)
%%   with 4 concurrent workers accessing the same table
%%
%% Note:
%% There are two config sections in wt.config {emdb, [ ... ]}. and
%% {emdb_, [ ... ]}.  The one being used is named "emdb" the other
%% config is ignored.  I setup an LSM and BTREE config and to choose
%% which is run you just rename those two sections (turn one off by
%% adding a "_" to the name and take the "_" out of the other's name).
